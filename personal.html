					<h1>About Me</h1>
					<p class="major">Welcome to my personal page! Here you'll learn more about who I am beyond academia and work.</p>
					
					<h2>Origins</h2>
					<p>I come from Urmia, a beautiful city in West Azerbaijan Province, Iran. Urmia is known for its stunning salty Lake Urmia (Formerly the largest lake in the Middle East and the sixth-largest saltwater lake on Earth), rich cultural heritage, and diverse ethnic background. The city has a unique blend of Azerbaijani, Kurdish, and Persian cultures, which has shaped my worldview and appreciation for diversity.</p>

					<h2>Hobbies & Interests</h2>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Mountaineering:</strong> As the president of the Mountaineering Club, I'm passionate about exploring peaks and challenging myself in nature.</li>
						<li><strong>Tennis:</strong> An active member of the UNR Tennis Club, I enjoy both the physical and strategic aspects of the game.</li>
						<li><strong>CrossFit:</strong> Dedicated to functional fitness and pushing my limits, CrossFit has become an integral part of my daily routine, helping me maintain both physical and mental strength.</li>
						<li><strong>Poker:</strong> I enjoy the strategic depth and psychological aspects of poker, where mathematics, game theory, and reading opponents come together in an exciting challenge.</li>
						<li><strong>Photography:</strong> I love capturing moments, especially during my outdoor adventures and travels.</li>
						<li><strong>Reading:</strong> I enjoy diving into books about technology, philosophy, and cultural studies.</li>
					</ul>

					<h2>Cultural Background</h2>
					<p>Growing up in Urmia has given me a unique perspective on life. The city's rich history as part of the ancient Persian Empire, combined with its modern multicultural identity, has taught me the value of diversity and cultural exchange. This background has been invaluable in my academic and professional journey in the United States.</p>

					<h2>Personal Philosophy</h2>
					<p>I believe in continuous learning, not just in academics but in all aspects of life. My experiences across different cultures and environments have taught me the importance of adaptability, resilience, and maintaining an open mind.</p>
